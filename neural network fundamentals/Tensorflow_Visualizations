# Visualization of Neural Network using Tensorflow Playground

Tensorflow Playground link: https://playground.tensorflow.org/


1. Network takes in features => sends to hidden layers => random weights are updated => to make prediction => visualized in graph

2. Compare prediction with "test loss" or "output" which tells you how "wrong" or "right" the neural nets prediction(s) are.

3. loss value is sent back through network so the model weights are updated 

4. Neural Net Processes

**"Forward propagation"**
left => right movement 
- random values sent through network
- weights updated 


**"Backward propagation"**
- obtain output or "test loss" from neural net prediction(s)
- feed data backwards through neural network and update model weights 


"Epochs"
- An Epoch is a cycle of "forward" and "backward" propagation through the network. 
- Obviously this can vary depending on the complexity of the network.

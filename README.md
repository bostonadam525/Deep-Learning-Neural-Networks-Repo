# Neural Networks and Deep Learning from Zero to Infinity and Beyond

* This is my repo for all things Deep Learning.
* The repo contains code, projects and experiments I have done using varying Python frameworks including:
1. NumPy
2. scikit-image
3. nibabel
4. Keras
5. Tensorflow
6. PyTorch


Image below is from the [Tensorflow Playground](https://playground.tensorflow.org/#activation=tanh&batchSize=10&dataset=circle&regDataset=reg-plane&learningRate=0.03&regularizationRate=0&noise=0&networkShape=4,2&seed=0.39392&showTestData=false&discretize=false&percTrainData=50&x=true&y=true&xTimesY=false&xSquared=false&ySquared=false&cosX=false&sinX=false&cosY=false&sinY=false&collectStats=false&problem=classification&initZero=false&hideText=false).
* The TF playground is a great place to visualize and experiment with neural network inputs, weights, biases, hidden layers, activation functions, loss, outputs and much more.
* The playground really helps visualize the architecture of a neural network before you translate it into code.
